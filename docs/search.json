I earned my Ph.D. in Human Development at University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by Dr. Richard Prather.\nIn my research, I aim to understand the cognitive factors that contribute to mathematical and scientific thinking and learning. Specifically, I examine how individuals engage domain-general skills, such as executive functioning and spatial/relational reasoning, while doing mathematical and scientific tasks. I do this by integrating methods from areas of developmental, cognitive, and educational psychology. The goal is to inform efforts in improving students’ learning, as early mathematical and scientific skills affect later academic achievement, career, and daily life."
