My research has explored cognitive and environmental factors that influence executive functions and STEM development through behavioral and computational studies.\nI received a M.Ed. in Educational Psychology - Applied Developmental Science from the University of Virginia, where I examined the relationship between spatial learning, spatial play, and mathematics. Prior to my graduate studies, I tutored K-6 students in mathematics in Cincinnati, Ohio, as an Ohio Math Corps and AmeriCorps member. My interest in developmental psychology started at The Ohio State University, where I received a B.A. in Psychology and investigated individuals’ ability to use inductive reasoning about novel categories.\nEmail: [email protected]\nLab Website: pratherlab.org // cogdevlab.umd.edu\nCV: PDF\nPublications: Google Scholar"
