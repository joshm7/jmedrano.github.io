# Josh Medrano, Ph.D. Candidate

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Human Development](https://education.umd.edu/academics/departments/hdqm) at [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu) working with [Dr. Richard Prather](https://pratherlab.org). My research has explored cognitive and environmental factors that influence executive functions and STEM development through behavioral and computational studies.

I received a M.Ed. in Educational Psychology - Applied Developmental Science from the University of Virginia, where I examined the relationship between spatial learning, spatial play, and mathematics. Prior to my graduate studies, I tutored K-6 students in mathematics in Cincinnati, Ohio, as an Ohio Math Corps and AmeriCorps member. My interest in developmental psychology started at The Ohio State University, where I received a B.A. in Psychology and investigated individuals' ability to use inductive reasoning about novel categories.
